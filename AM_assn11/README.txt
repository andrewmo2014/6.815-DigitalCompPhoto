Q1:How long did the assignment take?:
Many, many hours (20-30).  Thanks for the extension


Q2:Potential issues with your solution and explanation of partial completion (for partial credit):
	There may be some discrepancy from part I and part II due to the code being updated on stellar.  luckily part I only consisted of tutorials so was able to adjust.  I tried to write the correct python equivalent code for box schedules 5-7 however got confused with compute_at and correct process of producer and consumer (newly posted video helped).  Had trouble figuring out where to put the producer code and how much of the producer was needed so it would be ready for the consumer.
	LocalMax - had trouble clamping and using & rather than 'and', now should work
	GaussianSingleChannel - created horizontalGaussianKernel mathematically, did two blurs along the x, then the y.  Since using sum sugar, divided by kernel_width**2.  Hope this was the correct implementation, got reasonable results.
	Harris - wasn't sure when to clamp, i did it immediately when got image.
had trouble to think of best scheduling for sobel filter and wasn't sure whether to divide by sober.width()**2 since using sum sugar.
Had trouble getting the correct corner output.  Fixed by calculating threshold from response, then localMaximum from response, and finally anding them together.
Scheduling was difficult.  My default scheduling just used compute_root() for all functions (pretty fast).  Made it faster by using tiling and parallelism on the GaussianSingleChannel (tiles of size 256*128 from tutorial6).


Q3:Anything extra you may have implemented:
None added


Q4:Collaboration acknowledgement (but again, you must write your own code):
None, got everything I needed from office hours/piazza


Q5:What was most unclear/difficult?:
Scheduling and compute_at.  Had trouble understanding how it is done in Halide.  However, managed to understand most of it to complete the pset effectively.


Q6:What was most exciting?:
Getting harrisCorners to work properly.


Q7: How long did it take for the 2 schedules for the smooth gradient?

Q12: Describe your auto tuner in one paragraph
6.815 - If I were to implement a functional auto tuner, I would follow the same process as tutorial10_convolution scheduling.  I would focus on my gaussian and sobel convolutions because here I can take advantage of locality.  Then I would try different tile sizes other than my best 256*128.

Q13: What is the best schedule you found for Harris. 
6.815 - I just tried a schedule that took advantage of parallelism and locality.  I am sure I can do better.  I thought that focusing on how to schedule GaussianSingleChannel similar to tutorial10_convolution, I could get better results.  By using my best tile_size of (256*128), I was able to tile and take use of parallelism to get faster results.  As explained in my auto tuner, I would try different schedules as well as tile sizes.
