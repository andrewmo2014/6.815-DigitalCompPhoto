6.815: Assignment 1 - Basic Image Processing
9/11/2013
===============================================
1) The assignment took about 5 hours 
   (I had a lot of debugging and getting use to numpy)

2) Issues with solution
   - Some functions such as a1.spanish required my own contestant luminance (Y=0.5).
     May not match exactly with instructor's solution.
   - Histogram calculation should work, however, not as clean as wanted it to be.
     (Wanted to use less loops and take advantage of numpy library)
   - I added a1Outputs.py to write out png images in Output folder and test my results.

3) No Collaboration. I did not work with anyone in the class. I mainly got my questions
   answered via Piazza or google search

4) All seemed straight forward.  Easy to follow, only thing holding me back was debugging

5) I liked the Spanish Castle Illusion, very fun!
